/// answer on its own:
///
/// 1. **Before the first response.** A conversation restored from disk, or one
///    that has never run, has no reported usage at all. A gauge blank until the
///    first reply would be blank exactly when someone is deciding whether to
///    start.
/// 2. **The split.** Every provider reports one prompt total and no breakdown.
///    "62k used" answers a different question from "38k of it is tool output" —
///    only the second says what compacting would buy.
///
/// When a measured total exists the parts are **scaled to it** rather than shown
/// beside it, so the breakdown always sums to the number in the gauge above it.
/// Two numbers on one screen that disagree by 15% would leave the reader with no
/// way to tell which was wrong.
