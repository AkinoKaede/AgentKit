/// Each wrapped its durable write in its own unstructured `Task`, and separate
/// tasks have no order between them — so a `toolFinished` could be written
/// before the `toolStarted` it follows. Sequential tool calls hid most of it;
/// parallel ones would not.
///
/// `yield` on an `AsyncStream.Continuation` is ordered and safe from any
/// isolation, which is exactly what a fan-in point needs when the writers are a
/// task group of concurrently running tools. Durable events are handed to a
/// single drain task that awaits each write before starting the next, so
/// storage sees them in the order they happened rather than in whatever order
/// the scheduler got around to them.
